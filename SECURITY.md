# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you become aware of security-related issues or security vulnerabilities, please email the private intranet@tjhsst.edu list with the details necessary to reproduce the issue.

### When should I report a vulnerability
* You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Ion
* You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Ion
* You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Ion depends on
  * For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there
